Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server 
that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Docker CE is installed and running on the server. 
Ans- 
apt-get update 
- updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages


Install docker with below command. Bionic version is not available in katacoda hence xenial version is used.
sudo apt install -y docker-ce

Once it is installed, verify if the Docker service is started with command:
systemctl status docker


run the following command to start it if not alreday started:
systemctl start docker

Check docker version:
'docker -v' to get verion and build  and 'docker info' to get detailed information

Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.


Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist:
sudo groupadd docker

Add the connected user "$USER" to the docker group:
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker



The default logging driver is set to syslog.
To configure the Docker daemon to default to a specific logging driver, set the value of log-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json file,

{
  "log-driver": "syslog",
  "log-opts": {
    "syslog-address": "udp://1.2.3.4:1111"
  }
}

To find the current default logging driver for the Docker daemon
docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]

Good luck!
