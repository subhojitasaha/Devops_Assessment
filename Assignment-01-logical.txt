Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.



Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.

Ans- 

Len Function - The len() function returns the number of items (length) in an object.

eg- testList = [1, 2, 3]
print(testList, 'length is', len(testList))

Output: [1, 2, 3] length is 3

Round Function - The round() function returns a floating-point number rounded to the specified number of decimals.

eg- print(round(10.7))

Output: 11


Abs Function - The abs() method returns the absolute value of the given number. If the number is a complex number, abs() returns its magnitude.

eg- integer = -20
	print('Absolute value of -20 is:', abs(integer))
	
Output: Absolute value of -20 is: 20
