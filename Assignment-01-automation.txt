Strong Password Detection
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, 
and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.

import pyperclip, re

passwordRegex = re.compile(r'''(
    ^(?=.*[A-Z])                # at least one capital letters
     (?=.*[0-9].*[0-9])                 # at least two numeric digits
    (?=.*[a-z])          # at least one lower case letters
    .{8,}                              # at least 10 total digits
    $
    )''', re.VERBOSE)

def userInputPasswordCheck():
    ppass = input("Enter a potential password: ")
    mo = passwordRegex.search(ppass)
    if (not mo):
        print("Not strong, bling blong")
        return False
    else:
        print("Long, Strong, and down to get the crypto on")
        return True


userInputPasswordCheck()
