Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

Ans-

#!/bin/bash     
  
echo "Enter your first name: "  
read FIRSTNAME 
#echo "First name of Current User is $FIRSTNAME"
echo "Enter your last name: "  
read LASTNAME 
#echo "Last name of Current User is $LASTNAME"
echo "Enter your Age: "  
read USERAGE 
#echo "Age of Current User is $USERAGE"
echo "Hello Welcome $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME of Age $USERAGE years"
x=`expr $USERAGE + 10`
echo "After 10 years your age will be $x"
