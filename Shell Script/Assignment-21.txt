Create a simple script containing a single function. This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.

Ans- 

#!/bin/bash
# Basic function
function print_msg {
{
echo "it was generated when the function was run"
}
echo "it was generated outside of it"
