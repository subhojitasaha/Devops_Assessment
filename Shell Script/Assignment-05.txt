Write a script that runs three commands:

Evaluate an arithmetic expression:
Ans:

#!/bin/sh

a=10
b=20

val=`expr $a + $b`
echo "a + b : $val"
echo $?

Attempt to remove a file that does not exist in the current directory
Ans:

rm ./path/to/the/file/file_1.txt
echo $?

Evaluate another arithmetic expression
Ans:

x=30
y=5

val=`expr $a \* $b`
echo "a * b : $val"
echo $?

Immediately after each command, echo the exit status of that command to the terminal using the appropriate variable to show success and failure exit codes.
