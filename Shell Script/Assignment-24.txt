We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.

Ans-

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your Gender: Male OR Female "
read gender 
set $gender
f1()
{
    arms=2 
    legs=2 
    echo "$gender has $arms arms and $legs legs"
  male() 
  {
   beard=1 
    echo "You are a male and you have $beard beard"
  }
  
  female() 
  {
   beard=0
    echo "You are a female and you have $beard beard"
  }
}  
if [ "$gender" == "Male" ] ; then
    f1
    male
else 
    f1
    female
