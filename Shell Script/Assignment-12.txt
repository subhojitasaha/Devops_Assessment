Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

Ans- 

#!/bin/bash
echo "Guess a number between 1 to 3 : " 
read usernumber
if [ $usernumber -gt 3 -o $usernumber -lt 1 ]
then
echo "You have not follwed the instructions!"
else
echo "Well Done!"
