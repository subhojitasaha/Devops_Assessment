Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

Ans- 

#!/bin/bash
MYUSERNAME="Subhojita"
MYPASSWORD="Subhosah"
STARTOFSCRIPT="$(date)"
ENDOFSCRIPT="$(date)"
echo "My username is :$MYUSERNAME"
echo "My password is :$MYPASSWORD"
echo "$STARTOFSCRIPT "
echo "$ENDOFSCRIPT "
