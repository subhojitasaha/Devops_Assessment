Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

if [[ $usernumber -eq $mynumber ]]
then
echo "your guess is correct"
