Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hi I am Subhojita"
echo "I work in Capgemini" >> /dev/null
